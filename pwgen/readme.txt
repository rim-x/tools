Welcome to pwgen
-----------------
This is an open-source password generator for the command line.
it was written in python and doesn't need no other packages. 

Just run it in the command line and a random password will appear and it 
will be stored into a .txt file. 
it is maybe better to generate more passwords rather than just one.
 
Please make sure, that no one know's your passwords. 

for questions please contact me over github.com
